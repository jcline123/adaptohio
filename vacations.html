      <h2>Flying with a Young Amputee</h2>
      <p>
        On Gwen’s first flight, we kept her prosthetics on during takeoff. She was unusually upset and eventually told us her legs were hurting. We took her prosthetics off mid-flight and she immediately calmed down. Since then, we’ve always requested accessible pre-boarding to give us time to take her prosthetics off and store them comfortably before takeoff.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this may not affect all amputees, removing her prosthetics during flights has made traveling much more comfortable for Gwen. If your child shows signs of discomfort during air travel, this could be something to consider.
      </p>

      <h2>Bringing a Medical Bag on Flights</h2>
      <p>
        If your child needs medical supplies, mobility gear, or prosthetic care items when traveling, you’re allowed to bring an <strong>extra carry-on or checked bag free of charge</strong> on any U.S. airline. This is protected by the <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/passengers-disabilities" target="_blank">Air Carrier Access Act</a> and the Department of Transportation’s <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-II/subchapter-D/part-382/subpart-I/section-382.121" target="_blank">14 CFR § 382.121</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bag must be used <strong>exclusively for medical or assistive items</strong>, such as prosthetic liners, compression garments, wound care supplies, or assistive technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can use this medical bag as a carry-on or check it at the counter. Airlines cannot charge you a baggage fee for it, and it doesn't count toward your usual baggage limit. TSA may inspect it, but there’s no requirement for a doctor’s note or prescription—just pack the items together and let staff know it’s medical.
      </p>

      <p>

      <h2>Disney World</h2>
      <p>
        Of all the theme parks we’ve visited, <strong>Disney World</strong> has been by far the most accessible for Gwen. There hasn’t been a single ride or activity she couldn’t participate in. At Guest Services, we were able to get a stroller tag to use it as a wheelchair, allowing us to bring her stroller through the queue lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        The experience is seamless. No one questioned us or singled us out. Gwen just gets to be a kid. The atmosphere is inclusive and the cast members are consistently accommodating. We can’t recommend it enough.
      </p>

      <h2>Clearwater Marine Aquarium – INSPIRE Program</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.cmaquarium.org/inspiration/inspire-program/" target="_blank">Clearwater Marine Aquarium</a> in Florida is home to the late Winter the dolphin, whose story inspired the movie <em>Dolphin Tale</em>. Winter swam with a prosthetic tail after losing hers, and became a powerful symbol of hope and resilience for children with limb differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aquarium’s <a href="https://www.cmaquarium.org/inspiration/inspire-program/" target="_blank">INSPIRE Program</a> is specially designed to create meaningful experiences for individuals with limb differences and other challenges. Through personalized tours and educational encounters, the program celebrates diversity and determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we visited with Gwen, she had the incredible opportunity to see and touch one of Winter's prosthetic tails. It was a moving, unforgettable experience that helped her see how differences can be sources of strength and inspiration.

      <h2>Cedar Point</h2>
      <p>
        Our first trip to <strong>Cedar Point</strong> included some moments that made Gwen feel singled out because of her prosthetics. Ride operators frequently stopped us to verify eligibility, and some didn’t know how to address her disability appropriately. We shared feedback with the park about the need for better staff training and more consistent ADA procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when we returned this year, the experience had greatly improved. Gwen enjoyed the park without being questioned or delayed at any ride. Staff didn’t single her out, and she had an amazing time. We hope these changes continue and that other families experience the same kindness we did on our second visit.
