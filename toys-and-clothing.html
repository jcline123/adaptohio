      <p>Representation in the things kids play with and wear can be just as meaningful as what they watch or read. Below are toys, dolls, and apparel that celebrate limb differences and help kids feel seen.</p>

      <h2>Toys & Dolls</h2>

      <h3>American Girl</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.weareastepahead.com/step-ahead-provides-american-girl-dolls-prosthetic-limbs/" target="_blank">A Step Ahead Prosthetics</a> helps families modify American Girl dolls by adding custom prosthetic legs at no cost. It’s a wonderful way for kids with limb differences to see themselves in the toys they play with.
      </p>
      <p>
        We bought an American Girl doll for Gwen and shipped it to A Step Ahead. Their team added custom prosthetic legs that look amazing and even come off, which makes them extra special. It turned one of her favorite toys into something that truly represents her.

      <h3>Barbie</h3>
      <p>
      Barbie has slowly evolved to reflect a wider range of children and experiences. The first Barbie friend with a disability, Share a Smile Becky, was released in 1997. Becky used a wheelchair and quickly became a hit, though her wheelchair famously did not fit inside the Barbie Dreamhouse. She was discontinued a few years later but marked the beginning of a new era for representation in toys.
      </p>
      <p>
      In 2019, Mattel released the first Barbie with a prosthetic leg as part of the Fashionistas collection. The design included a removable prosthetic leg that allowed kids to explore and understand limb differences in play. Since then, several other dolls have followed, including another Fashionista in 2022 and a Ken doll with a prosthetic leg in 2023. A newer version was released in 2024, continuing Barbie’s effort to include characters with different abilities in everyday play.
      </p>
      <p>
      Mattel has also introduced other inclusive dolls in recent years, such as Barbie with hearing aids, Barbie with vitiligo, a bald Barbie, and one representing a person with Down syndrome. In 2024, a Barbie with a visual impairment joined the lineup, complete with a white cane and braille packaging. These additions help make the Barbie world more reflective of the real one and offer kids more ways to see themselves and their friends in the toys they play with.
      </p>

      <h3>Mayana & Friends</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://hellomayana.com/" target="_blank">Mayana & Friends</a> is a small Filipino-Canadian family business that makes plush animals with limb differences. The company started when the founder’s child was born with an upper limb difference, and she wanted to create toys that reflect the real world our kids live in. Each character has its own little story, helping families talk about differences in a natural, friendly way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gwen’s favorite is <a href="https://hellomayana.com/products/lou" target="_blank">Lou the Cat</a>, who has an above-the-knee limb difference and loves exploring outdoors and looking for bugs under logs and rocks. Lou is curious and confident, always learning new things in her own way.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s also <a href="https://hellomayana.com/products/dougie" target="_blank">Dougie</a>, who loves music and makes everyone laugh; 
        <a href="https://hellomayana.com/products/edie" target="_blank">Edie</a>, who finds joy in gardening and growing raspberries; 
        <a href="https://hellomayana.com/products/miko" target="_blank">Miko</a>, a creative monkey with a knack for art; 
        and <a href="https://hellomayana.com/products/ziggy" target="_blank">Ziggy</a>, a sporty alligator who dreams of the Paralympics. 
        Together they make a world where every character is different, but they all belong.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s great about Mayana & Friends is how naturally it fits into playtime. These toys make space for every kind of kid to see themselves and their friends in the stories they imagine.
      </p>

      <h3>Budsies</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.budsies.com/selfies-services/" target="_blank">Budsies</a> offers a fun and easy way to create a doll that looks like your child. Their “Selfies” service lets you send in a photo, and their team turns it into a custom plush version—same clothes, hairstyle, and even little details that make your child who they are. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For kids with limb differences, it’s a simple way to have a toy that truly represents them. You can include any detail you’d like, and the finished doll comes back soft, friendly, and personal. It’s one of those ideas that seems small but can mean a lot when a child sees themselves reflected in something they can hold.
      </p>

      <h3>Autumn (LEGO Friends)</h3>
      <p>
        In 2023, LEGO introduced Autumn, one of the new Friends characters, and she’s the first LEGO minidoll with a molded limb difference. Her design includes a visible upper limb difference as part of who she is, not something added or removed later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Autumn lives on a ranch, spends time outdoors, and loves caring for animals. Her sets, like <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/autumns-room-42646" target="_blank">Autumn’s Room</a>, reflect her interests with things like plants, art supplies, and nature-themed accessories. It’s a nice example of a popular toy line including characters who look a little different without making it the focus of their story.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Generation Dolls with Prosthetic Legs (Target)</h3>
      <p>
      By 2021, Target’s Our Generation line had introduced two 18-inch dolls featuring prosthetic legs, <strong>Kacy</strong> and <strong>Suzee</strong>. These dolls were part of Our Generation’s effort to bring more inclusion and representation into their toy line. Both came with a removable prosthetic leg decorated with small heart designs and wore a floral dress with a pink cardigan. Their stories focused on friendship, imagination, and everyday play, showing that limb differences are simply part of life.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Kacy</strong> was released around 2020 and has long blonde hair and brown eyes. She came with a detachable prosthetic leg and a bright, friendly personality. <strong>Suzee</strong> followed in 2021, with a medium skin tone, dark brown hair, and brown eyes. Like Kacy, she included a removable prosthetic leg with heart details and wore the same cheerful outfit.
      </p>

      <p>
      Although these dolls are no longer in production, they can sometimes be found on eBay and other secondhand resale sites.
      </p>

      <h2>Clothing</h2>

      <h3>Mermaid Strides</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.mermaidstrides.com" target="_blank">Mermaid Strides</a> is an Etsy store creating inspiring apparel that celebrates limb differences. 
        Their designs feature unique, kid-friendly characters with prosthetic limbs and other limb differences, helping children see strength and joy reflected in every piece.
