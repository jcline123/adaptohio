        We're the parents of a little girl named Gwendolyn, who was born with fibular hemimelia and apodia. At 9 months old, she had amputation surgeries and now walks, runs, and plays as a bilateral below-knee amputee. When she was born, we had so many questions and very few answers. No one handed us a guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is where we're sharing what we've learned so far: from early intervention and adaptive sports to accessible parks and programs. While our experience centers on limb differences, many of these resources will be helpful to families of children with various disabilities. Our hope is that this guide makes your path a little clearer.
