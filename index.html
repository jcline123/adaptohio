      <p>
        We're the parents of a little girl named Gwendolyn, who was born with fibular hemimelia and apodia. At 9 months old, she underwent amputation surgeries and now walks, runs, and plays as a bilateral below-knee amputee. When she was born, we had so many questions—and very few answers. No one handed us a guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is our way of sharing everything we've learned so far—about early intervention, adaptive sports, accessible parks, and more. While our experience is specific to limb differences, many of these resources apply to families of children with a wide range of disabilities. We hope Adapt Ohio helps make your journey a little easier.
