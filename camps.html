      <h2>Camp No Limits</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.nolimitsfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Camp No Limits</a> is a nationwide program for children with limb loss or limb differences and their families. While there isn't currently a camp in Ohio, there are several nearby options. We've been attending the camp just north of Chicago, and it’s been one of the most impactful communities we’ve been a part of.
      </p>
      <p>
        The camp offers adaptive recreation, therapy sessions, mentorship, and family workshops in a fun and supportive setting. What makes Camp No Limits special is how it brings together kids, parents, and adult mentors with limb differences, offering connection and encouragement for everyone. Gwen loves being surrounded by kids like her, and as parents, we’ve learned so much from talking to other families.
      </p>

        <a href="https://nubability.org/" target="_blank">NubAbility Athletics Foundation</a> is a nonprofit organization that empowers children with limb differences to participate in mainstream sports. Founded in 2011 by Sam Kuhnert, who was born with one hand, the foundation offers nationwide camps where limb-different youth receive coaching from athletes who share similar experiences. These camps cover a wide range of sports, including baseball, basketball, swimming, and more, fostering confidence and skill development in a supportive environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation's mission is to encourage, inspire, and instruct limb-different youth by getting them out of the stands, off the bench, and into the game. Through mentorship and tailored coaching, NubAbility helps young athletes realize their potential both on and off the field.

        The <a href="https://luckyfinproject.org/" target="_blank">Lucky Fin Project</a> supports kids with limb differences by creating community, raising awareness, and celebrating differences. Every year, they host a Lucky Fin Weekend in Michigan, and we’ve taken Gwen there to connect with other families.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event is filled with meetups, educational sessions, and social activities for kids and their families. Gwen gets to play and make friends with other limb-different kids, and we get to meet parents who’ve been through similar experiences. It’s a great reminder that we’re not alone—and a fun and uplifting weekend for the whole family.
