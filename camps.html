      <h2>Camp No Limits</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.nolimitsfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Camp No Limits</a> is a nationwide program for children with limb loss or limb differences and their families. While there isn't currently a camp in Ohio, there are several nearby options. We've been attending the camp just north of Chicago, and it’s been one of the most impactful communities we’ve been a part of.
      </p>
      <p>
        The camp offers adaptive recreation, therapy sessions, mentorship, and family workshops in a fun and supportive setting. What makes Camp No Limits special is how it brings together kids, parents, and adult mentors with limb differences, offering connection and encouragement for everyone. Gwen loves being surrounded by kids like her, and as parents, we’ve learned so much from talking to other families.
      </p>

      <h2>Lucky Fin Weekend</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://luckyfinproject.org/" target="_blank">Lucky Fin Project</a> supports kids with limb differences by creating community, raising awareness, and celebrating differences. Every year, they host a Lucky Fin Weekend in Michigan, and we’ve taken Gwen there to connect with other families.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event is filled with meetups, educational sessions, and social activities for kids and their families. Gwen gets to play and make friends with other limb-different kids, and we get to meet parents who’ve been through similar experiences. It’s a great reminder that we’re not alone—and a fun and uplifting weekend for the whole family.
