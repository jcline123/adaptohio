      <h2>Skin & Prosthetic Care</h2>
      <p>
        We've found that daily skin care and prosthetic hygiene make a big difference for Gwen's comfort and mobility. We apply Aquaphor to her legs every day to keep her skin healthy and avoid irritation. For cleaning, we use <a href="https://www.aquaphorus.com/products/aquaphor/aquaphor-baby-wash-and-shampoo-25-4floz" target="_blank">Aquaphor baby unscented soap</a>, which has been gentle on her skin. We had issues when using scented soap, but after switching, we haven’t had any problems. We also wipe down her liners with alcohol wipes every few days.

      <h2>Set 1: First Prosthetics</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen received her first set of prosthetic legs around her first birthday. To keep her as short as possible for better balance, the foot was attached directly to the socket. She used a <a href="https://willowwood.com/product/pediatric-sach-foot/" target="_blank">basic SACH foot</a>, which worked well at this early stage. Her socket system used a pelite liner and an external suspension sleeve that rolled up over her thigh to secure the prosthetic. That sleeve can be seen <a href="https://www.wearesp.com/prosthetic-knee-sleeves/flexi-kids-sleeve" target="_blank">here</a>. Overall, this setup allowed her to learn how to walk with no major issues.

      <h2>Set 2: Upgraded Feet</h2>
      <p>
        Her second set of legs retained the same socket and suspension sleeve setup <a href="https://www.wearesp.com/prosthetic-knee-sleeves/flexi-kids-sleeve" target="_blank">(Flexi Kids Sleeve)</a>, but she received upgraded feet: the <a href="https://www.college-park.com/scout" target="_blank">Scout foot</a>. This made a huge difference in her walking. She became noticeably faster and more agile. The only downside came later when we began potty training — the high-thigh sleeves made bathroom access more difficult. Otherwise, this set of legs performed very well.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Set 3: Gel Liners & Pin Locks</h2>
      <p>
        For Gwen’s third set, we transitioned to a gel liner system with a pin lock mechanism. This setup ended just above the knee, which made potty training much easier. However, getting pediatric gel liners to fit her small legs was a challenge — many companies don’t custom-make liners for kids. To address this, we used a <a href="https://www.ossur.com/en-us/prosthetics/liners/iceross-distal-cup" target="_blank">distal cup</a> on one leg and <a href="https://shop.ottobock.us/Prosthetics/Lower-Limb-Prosthetics/Socket-Technologies-Liners/Padding/Spots/p/616S134" target="_blank">gel spots</a> on the other to improve fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also switched to the <a href="https://www.college-park.com/truper" target="_blank">Truper foot</a> with this set. While the Truper offered more movement for uneven surfaces, we found that Gwen’s gait wasn’t as smooth as it had been with the Scout foot. In hindsight, we would’ve stayed with the Scout — it seemed to provide better stability and stride for her.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Set 4: Formula Foot</h2>
      <p>
        Her current setup still uses the gel liner and pin lock system, but with the <a href="https://fillauer.com/product/formula-pediatric/" target="_blank">Formula pediatric foot</a>. This has been by far the best prosthetic system Gwen has used. Her gait is significantly smoother and faster. One major change we noticed immediately was that the jarring impact of her foot hitting the ground — something we could feel just by holding her hand — was completely gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gwen became more stable and confident overnight. For example, she started alternating her feet naturally when going up and down stairs without any prompting. Her walking pace increased, and her overall posture improved. This foot has been a complete game-changer, and we expect to stick with it going forward.
