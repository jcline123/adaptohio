      <h2>Set 1: First Prosthetics</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen received her first set of prosthetics around her first birthday. These featured a <a href="https://willowwood.com/product/pediatric-sach-foot/" target="_blank">basic SACH foot</a> attached directly to the socket to keep her low to the ground and stable. Her suspension system used a pe-lite liner and a <a href="https://www.wearesp.com/prosthetic-knee-sleeves/flexi-kids-sleeve" target="_blank">Flexi Kids sleeve</a> that rolled up to her thigh. This setup worked well for early walking and balance.
      </p>

      <h2>Set 2: Scout Foot & Increased Mobility</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen's second set of legs retained the same socket and suspension system, but introduced the <a href="https://www.college-park.com/scout" target="_blank">Scout foot</a> by College Park. This made a huge improvement in mobility. She got faster and more confident. The only downside was that the thigh-high sleeves became cumbersome during potty training.
      </p>

      <h2>Set 3: Gel Liners & Pin Locks</h2>
      <p>
        For the third set, we switched to <a href="https://willowwood.com/product/alpha-classic-akc/" target="_blank">gel liners with a pin lock system</a> which stopped just above the knee—much better for potty training. Getting a good fit was tricky since pediatric gel liners are limited. We used an <a href="https://www.ossur.com/en-us/prosthetics/liners/iceross-distal-cup" target="_blank">Iceross distal cup</a> on one leg and <a href="https://shop.ottobock.us/Prosthetics/Lower-Limb-Prosthetics/Socket-Technologies-Liners/Padding/Spots/p/616S134" target="_blank">Ottobock gel spots</a> on the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also tried the <a href="https://www.college-park.com/truper" target="_blank">Truper foot</a>, but in our experience the Scout foot provided a smoother gait. While the Truper foot offered more flexibility for uneven surfaces, Gwen seemed more stable overall in the Scout foot.
      </p>

      <h2>Set 4: Formula Foot</h2>
      <p>
        For Gwen’s fourth set, we kept the gel liner and pin lock system but switched to the <a href="https://fillauer.com/product/formula-pediatric/" target="_blank">Formula pediatric foot by Fillauer</a>. This has been a game-changer. Gwen’s gait is smoother, her steps are quieter and more stable, and her confidence on stairs and inclines improved noticeably. It’s our favorite foot so far.
      </p>

      <h2>Skin & Prosthetic Care</h2>
      <p>
        We apply Aquaphor daily to keep Gwen’s skin healthy. To clean her liners and sockets, we use <a href="https://www.aquaphorus.com/products/aquaphor/aquaphor-baby-wash-and-shampoo-25-4floz" target="_blank">Aquaphor Baby Unscented Soap</a>. We had issues with irritation from scented soap, but switching to unscented resolved that. Every few days, we also wipe down her liners with an alcohol wipe for extra cleanliness.
