      <h2>Skin & Prosthetic Care</h2>
      <p>
        We use Aquaphor daily to keep Gwen’s skin healthy and prevent irritation. For cleaning, we’ve found that <a href="https://www.aquaphorus.com/products/aquaphor/aquaphor-baby-wash-and-shampoo-25-4floz" target="_blank">Aquaphor Baby Unscented Soap</a> works well without causing skin issues. We previously tried a scented soap that led to irritation. In addition to washing, we wipe down her liners with alcohol wipes every few days.

      <h2>Set 1: First Prosthetics</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen received her first set of prosthetics around her first birthday. These had a basic foot, the <a href="https://willowwood.com/product/pediatric-sach-foot/" target="_blank">Pediatric SACH Foot</a>, attached directly to the socket to keep her low to the ground for better balance. Her socket used a PE-lite liner and a <a href="https://www.wearesp.com/prosthetic-knee-sleeves/flexi-kids-sleeve" target="_blank">suspension sleeve</a> that rolled up her thigh. This system worked well, and Gwen learned to walk with no major issues.

      <h2>Set 2: Scout Foot</h2>
      <p>
        Her second set kept the same socket and suspension system. The main upgrade was switching to the <a href="https://www.college-park.com/scout" target="_blank">Scout foot</a>, which made a big difference. Gwen became significantly faster and more agile. The only drawback was that potty training became harder due to the high sleeve that needed to be rolled up each time.

      <h2>Set 3: Gel Liners & Pin Locks</h2>
      <p>
        For Gwen’s third set of prosthetics, we moved to a gel liner with a pin lock mechanism. This allowed the suspension to end just above the knee, which helped a lot during potty training. However, finding gel liners that fit was a major challenge since pediatric sizes are limited. We ended up using a <a href="https://www.ossur.com/en-us/prosthetics/liners/iceross-distal-cup" target="_blank">distal cup</a> on one leg to improve the liner fit and <a href="https://shop.ottobock.us/Prosthetics/Lower-Limb-Prosthetics/Socket-Technologies-Liners/Padding/Spots/p/616S134" target="_blank">gel spots</a> on the other to ensure proper contact and security.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also switched to the <a href="https://www.college-park.com/truper" target="_blank">Truper foot</a> on this set. While it offered more movement on uneven surfaces, Gwen didn’t seem as stable in them as she was with the Scout foot. Her gait was smoother and more controlled with the Scout, so in hindsight we would have stuck with that option.

      <h2>Set 4: Formula Foot</h2>
      <p>
        On Gwen’s fourth set of prosthetics, we kept the gel liner and pin lock system but upgraded to the <a href="https://fillauer.com/product/formula-pediatric/" target="_blank">Formula pediatric foot</a>. This has been a massive improvement in every way. Gwen now walks at a faster pace and with more stability. When holding her hand while walking, you can feel the difference—there's no longer a jarring impact when her foot hits the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her gait is smoother, and she has a much softer step. We noticed an immediate improvement in her ability to alternate feet on stairs and maintain balance on inclines. This foot has given her more confidence and comfort than anything we've used so far. Going forward, it's hard to imagine using anything else.
