      <h2>Skin Care & Prosthetic Cleaning</h2>
      <p>To keep Gwen’s skin healthy, we use Aquaphor daily. For cleaning her liners and sockets, we use Aquaphor Baby Unscented Soap, which helped resolve previous skin irritation caused by scented soaps. Additionally, we wipe down her liners with alcohol wipes every few days to keep everything fresh and clean.</p>

      <h2>Set 1: First Prosthetics</h2>
      <p>Gwen received her first set of prosthetics around her first birthday. The setup included a basic <a href="https://willowwood.com/product/pediatric-sach-foot/" target="_blank">pediatric SACH foot</a> attached directly to the socket, keeping her low to the ground for better balance. The socket used a PE-Lite liner and a <a href="https://www.wearesp.com/prosthetic-knee-sleeves/flexi-kids-sleeve" target="_blank">suspension sleeve</a> that rolled up over her thigh. This system helped her learn to walk with no major issues.</p>

      <h2>Set 2: Scout Foot Upgrade</h2>
      <p>This set kept the same socket and suspension sleeve but upgraded to the <a href="https://www.college-park.com/scout" target="_blank">Scout foot</a>. Gwen did very well in this setup and gained a lot of speed and confidence. However, once potty training started, the high suspension sleeve became a hassle. Otherwise, these legs worked great for her.</p>

      <h2>Set 3: Gel Liners & Pin Locks</h2>
      <p>For the third set, we moved to a gel liner and pin lock system, which stops just above the knee, this made potty training much easier. Finding liners that fit Gwen properly was challenging since most manufacturers don’t make custom gel liners for small kids. On one leg, we used a <a href="https://www.ossur.com/en-us/prosthetics/liners/iceross-distal-cup" target="_blank">distal cup</a> to help with fit. On the other leg, we used <a href="https://shop.ottobock.us/Prosthetics/Lower-Limb-Prosthetics/Socket-Technologies-Liners/Padding/Spots/p/616S134" target="_blank">gel spots</a> to get everything aligned correctly.</p>
      <p>This set also included the <a href="https://www.college-park.com/truper" target="_blank">Truper foot</a>. It offered more flexibility for uneven surfaces, but Gwen's gait didn’t feel as smooth as it was with the Scout foot from Set 2. If we were doing it again, we’d likely stick with the Scout foot instead.</p>

      <h2>Set 4: Formula Foot</h2>
      <p>This latest set kept the gel liner and pin system, but we upgraded to the <a href="https://fillauer.com/product/formula-pediatric/" target="_blank">Formula pediatric foot</a>. This foot has been a massive improvement. Gwen now walks faster, and when holding her hand, we no longer feel the shock of each footfall like we did with previous feet. Her steps are softer, her balance improved immediately, and she began alternating feet on stairs without any prompting. The Formula foot has been a huge success, and we plan to continue using it going forward.</p>
