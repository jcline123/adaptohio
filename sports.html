      <!-- Sled Hockey Section -->
      <h2>Sled Hockey</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen joined <a href="https://ohiosledhockey.org/columbus-blades/" target="_blank">Columbus Blades Sled Hockey</a> last year at just three years old. We're told some kids even start earlier. It's a supportive and encouraging group, and Gwen absolutely loves it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When the season began, she could barely move her sled on the ice. By the end, she was cruising around the rink confidently. Beyond just being fun, we believe sled hockey is helping build her upper body and core strength in a natural, engaging way.
      </p>

      <!-- Chance to Dance Section -->
      <h2>Chance to Dance</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen participates in the <a href="https://www.easterseals.com/centralohio/programs-and-services/childrens-services/chance-to-dance.html" target="_blank">Chance to Dance</a> program at Easterseals, but it’s open to any child who wants to join. The program is run by trained dance instructors who work with children of all abilities and mobility levels, offering joyful and expressive movement classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gwen loves her dance class. It’s not only fun and creative, but it also helps with balance, coordination, and confidence. It’s a welcoming, inclusive environment that celebrates every child's unique ability to move.
      </p>

      <!-- Miracle League Section -->
      <h2>The Miracle League</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen recently started playing baseball with <a href="https://www.miracleleaguecentraloh.org/" target="_blank">The Miracle League of Central Ohio</a>. The adaptive field is flat and smooth, which makes a big difference for Gwen. Not having curbs or grass to trip on means she can focus on having fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group has been a great experience so far, and Gwen is having a lot of fun. The Miracle League gives children of all abilities the chance to enjoy baseball in an environment designed for them.
      </p>

      <!-- TOPSoccer Section -->
      <h2>TOPSoccer</h2>
      <p>
        We’ve also enrolled Gwen in <a href="https://www.prairietownship.org/444/TOPSoccer" target="_blank">TOPSoccer</a>, a community-based soccer program designed for kids with disabilities. We tried other mainstream soccer programs before, but uneven ground and tall grass were big challenges for Gwen.
      </p>
      <p>
        At TOPSoccer, she plays on a smooth, accessible field with other children who face similar challenges. It’s a much more fun and comfortable experience for her. The volunteers and coaches are supportive, and the program is focused on inclusion and development.
        You can explore more programs around the state through <a href="https://ohio-soccer.org/parents/topsoccer/" target="_blank">Ohio Soccer's TOPSoccer directory</a>.
