      <!-- Sled Hockey Section -->
      <h2>Sled Hockey</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen joined <a href="https://ohiosledhockey.org/columbus-blades/" target="_blank">Columbus Blades Sled Hockey</a> last year at just three years old. We're told some kids even start earlier. It's a supportive and encouraging group, and Gwen absolutely loves it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When the season began, she could barely move her sled on the ice. By the end, she was cruising around the rink confidently. Beyond just being fun, we believe sled hockey is helping build her upper body and core strength in a natural, engaging way.
      </p>

      <!-- Chance to Dance Section -->
      <h2>Chance to Dance</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen participates in the <a href="https://www.easterseals.com/centralohio/programs-and-services/childrens-services/chance-to-dance.html" target="_blank">Chance to Dance</a> program at Easterseals, but it’s open to any child with a disability. The program is run by an instructor who works with children of all abilities and mobility levels, offering joyful and expressive movement classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gwen loves her dance class. It’s not only fun and creative, but it also helps with balance, coordination, and confidence. It’s a welcoming, inclusive environment that celebrates every child's unique ability to move.
      </p>

      <!-- Miracle League Section -->
      <h2>The Miracle League</h2>
      <p>
        Gwen recently started playing baseball with <a href="https://www.miracleleaguecentraloh.org/" target="_blank">The Miracle League of Central Ohio</a>. The adaptive field is flat and smooth, which makes a big difference for Gwen. Not having curbs or grass to trip on means she can focus on having fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group has been a great experience so far, and Gwen is having a lot of fun. The Miracle League gives children of all abilities the chance to enjoy baseball in an environment designed for them.
      </p>

      <!-- TOPSoccer Section -->
      <h2>TOPSoccer</h2>
      <p>
        We’ve also enrolled Gwen in <a href="https://www.prairietownship.org/444/TOPSoccer" target="_blank">TOPSoccer</a>, a community-based soccer program designed for kids with disabilities. We tried other mainstream soccer programs before, but uneven ground and tall grass were big challenges for Gwen.
      </p>
      <p>
        At TOPSoccer, she plays on a smooth, accessible field with other children who face similar challenges. It’s a much more fun and comfortable experience for her. The volunteers and coaches are supportive, and the program is focused on inclusion and development.
        You can explore more programs around the state through <a href="https://ohio-soccer.org/parents/topsoccer/" target="_blank">Ohio Soccer's TOPSoccer directory</a>.

      <!-- Adaptive Cycling: Magnetic Pedals -->
      <section class="callout-box" id="adaptive-cycling">
        <h2>Adaptive Cycling: Magnetic Pedals That Helped Gwen</h2>
        <p class="byline">Parent-tested tip, shared with thanks to <a href="https://hustlebikelabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hustle Bike Labs</a></p>

        <p>
          When Gwen first started riding her bike, she had a hard time keeping her feet on the pedals. I went to a local cycle shop and asked if we could try a pair of cage pedals, which helped a lot. She was able to ride pretty well, but getting her feet set on the pedals and stepping off the bike was still tricky.

          At Camp No Limits, we met an amputee who told us about the magnetic pedals made by Hustle Bike Labs. I thought that was such a great idea. These pedals are designed for adults who use cycling shoes with a metal plate attached where a clip-in pedal would normally go. Before buying a pair, I reached out to Hustle to ask if they thought the magnets would be strong enough to work through a child’s shoe if we added a small piece of metal inside.

          Hustle was incredibly kind, they went out of their way to test the idea and even mailed us custom magnetic shoe inserts and pedals for Gwen to try. The magnets don’t hold her feet rigidly in place, but she can feel them pull her prosthetic feet toward the pedals, which makes it much easier for her to keep her footing while she rides. If she starts to lose balance, she can still lift her feet off quickly to steady herself.

          It’s been such a great solution for her, much better than the cages. We’re so thankful to Hustle for taking the time to help make this work for Gwen, and we can’t recommend them enough.

      <!-- Horseback Riding Section -->
      <h2>Horseback Riding</h2>
      <p>
        We've discovered there are quite a few therapeutic horseback riding programs around Central Ohio and beyond. The connection between kids and horses can be really special, and many of these programs focus on building confidence, balance, and social skills in a supportive environment.
      </p>

      <h3>Stockhands Horses for Healing - Delaware</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.stockhands.org/" target="_blank">Stockhands Horses for Healing</a> creates a positive, non-judgmental environment where kids and families can build relationships with horses through therapeutic services. They're located in Delaware and focus on empowering participants through creative equine-assisted programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's neat is they offer some unique programs beyond traditional riding, including "Read with the Horses" on the second Saturday of each month. It's designed for readers of all ages and abilities to practice reading without pressure - the horses make for patient listeners. They also have special programs for veterans and first responders.
      </p>

      <h3>Dreams on Horseback - Blacklick</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://dreamsonhorseback.org/" target="_blank">Dreams on Horseback</a> is a PATH International accredited center in Blacklick that serves over 1,200 participants each year.

      <p>
        They have a big operation with 26 horse partners and over 500 volunteers, which gives you a sense of how established and supported the program is. Beyond riding, they also offer field trips, team building, and vocational training programs.
      </p>

      <h3>Discovery Riders - Bellefontaine</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://discoveryriders.org/" target="_blank">Discovery Riders</a> in Bellefontaine focuses on "changing lives one ride at a time." They welcome riders of all ages and abilities, providing equine-assisted activities designed to build confidence, develop life skills, and create connections between riders and specially trained horses.

      <p>
        Their horses are carefully selected and trained to give honest, immediate feedback, which helps kids learn social rules and interactions in a safe way. They also offer horse camps at different skill levels throughout the summer, and they participate in Special Olympics programs.

      <h3>Flying Horse Farms - Delaware</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://flyinghorsefarms.org/" target="_blank">Flying Horse Farms</a> is a bit different from the other programs - it's a medical specialty camp for kids with serious illnesses. While not exclusively a riding program, horses are part of their therapeutic camp experience, and all programs are provided at no cost to families.

        If your child has a serious medical condition, this might be worth looking into as part of a broader camp experience that includes time with horses alongside other activities designed for healing and growth.
