      <p>We were fortunate to hear Sydney read this book to Gwen and other kids at Camp HALO, and it was such a powerful moment. The warm and inviting picture book takes young readers along on Sydney's journey through the joyous ups as well as the crushing downs, and tells the story of how through it all, she kept dancing. Sydney is an incredible role model who shows kids that pursuing your dreams and celebrating your individuality can lead to amazing places. <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250842671/shekeptdancing/" target="_blank">View on Macmillan</a></p>
