      <h2>YCS (formerly ECRN+)</h2>
      <p><a href="https://ymcacolumbus.org/locations/ecrn" target="_blank">YCS</a>, previously known as ECRN+, is part of the YMCA of Central Ohio. It supports families with children who have developmental delays, disabilities, or health care needs—from infancy through early childhood.</p>
      <p>Their services include early intervention (0–3), developmental screenings for preschoolers, family support, SPARK (school readiness), Stable Families programs, and lending adaptive equipment like walkers, sensory tools, and feeding chairs. They also host community events like adaptive kayaking, hiking, and inclusive play groups.</p>
      <p>YCS empowers over 2,000 Ohio families each year by helping navigate therapies, community resources, and school readiness. You can contact them at <a href="tel:614-389-3880">(614) 389‑3880</a> or visit 1907 Leonard Ave, Columbus, OH 43219.</p>

      <h2>May We Help</h2>
      <p><a href="https://maywehelp.org/" target="_blank">May We Help</a> is a volunteer‑run nonprofit based in Cincinnati. Skilled teams of engineers, designers, therapists, and makers build custom adaptive devices at no cost for people whose needs aren’t met by off‑the‑shelf products. In 2023 they logged over 10,000 volunteer hours and delivered hundreds of custom solutions.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>
      <p>They offer services like adaptive equipment swaps—where families can pick up or donate items like wheelchairs, gait trainers, and strollers—and create one‑off devices such as wheelchair accessories or switches for toys and tools. Since 2019, they’ve distributed over $1.8M in equipment for free.</p>
      <p>Projects are coordinated from their workshop and often involve a discovery visit, design/build phase, and final delivery. To start, families can complete a <a href="https://maywehelp.org/request-a-solution-application/" target="_blank">Request for Help form</a>. Services are free, and volunteers will often travel to families where needed.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>
