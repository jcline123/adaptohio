      <p>
        We chose to go with Nationwide Children’s Hospital because it was part of our care journey from day one. Gwen was born at Riverside Hospital in Columbus, which is affiliated with Children’s, and before we were even discharged we already had our first orthopedic appointment scheduled. That made everything feel a little easier. Children’s also has a dedicated limb difference clinic, and from our earliest conversations with her orthopedic doctors and surgeons, we felt like Gwen was in very good hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        I often think about how lucky we were not to have to travel for care. Limb difference is a rare diagnosis, and finding the right team can be overwhelming. In Gwen’s case, she was born without feet and her needs were actually fairly straightforward compared to many other cases. We didn’t have to weigh options like limb lengthening versus amputation. She did need an amputation on one side and a plastic surgery procedure on the other, but the path forward was clear. I know not every family has that kind of clarity, and I hope this page helps provide some reassurance and starting points.
      </p>

      <p>
        After her surgeries, we were surprised to learn that Children’s didn’t make the prosthetics. Like many new parents, we assumed that everything would happen through the hospital. Suddenly we were trying to figure out how to find a prosthetist. We called a few different companies in the area and ended up choosing Hanger Clinic. Their office was close to home, and the prosthetist we spoke to on the phone took the time to explain the process and even gave us a list of questions to ask other providers. He still works with us today.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ve had a good experience with both Children’s and Hanger. Our prosthetist actually attends many of our orthopedic appointments, which is incredibly helpful. Having your doctor and prosthetist in the same room talking through adjustments and decisions has made a big difference. This is the only provider team we’ve used so far, but we’ve been really happy with the care and support Gwen has received.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.nemours.org/find-a-doctor/4539-shawn-standard-orthopedics-orlando.html" target="_blank">Dr. Shawn Standard – Nemours Children’s Health</a></h3>

        Dr. Shawn Standard is one of the names we see most often in limb difference communities. He’s part of the orthopedic team at Nemours Children’s Health in Orlando and is especially well known for treating kids with fibular hemimelia and other congenital conditions. Families across the country talk about his ability to explain complex treatment plans in a way that makes sense and his dedication to finding the best possible outcomes. Many parents say they knew after one visit that he was the right fit for their child. Even if you’re not in Florida, it may be worth reaching out if you’re looking for a second opinion or exploring surgical options.
      </p>
      
      <h3><a href="https://www.limblength.org/about-us/why-choose-us/pediatric-orthopedics/" target="_blank">Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) – LLCRS</a></h3>

        The Limb Lengthening and Complex Reconstruction Service (LLCRS) at HSS in New York City is one of the most respected programs in the country for pediatric limb differences. Their team focuses on limb lengthening, deformity correction, and limb preservation—often offering options families may not have heard elsewhere. Many people we’ve connected with online have traveled to HSS for second opinions or to pursue specialized treatments not available locally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their approach is highly individualized, combining surgical expertise with advanced imaging, rehab planning, and long-term follow-up. Families often say they feel heard, supported, and included in every decision. If you're facing a complex diagnosis or just want another perspective, LLCRS is a name that comes up again and again for a reason.

      <h2>Physical Therapy</h2>

      <h3><a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/specialties/physical-therapy" target="_blank">Nationwide Children’s Hospital</a></h3>
      <p>
        Gwen started physical therapy at Nationwide Children’s after she got her first set of prosthetic legs. We’ve gone to both their Hilliard and Dublin locations, and from the very beginning the therapists made a huge difference. In the early days, they focused on helping her stand up with her legs, take her first steps, and build strength. They also helped us as parents feel more confident by showing us what to work on at home and how to support her safely.
      </p>
      <p>
        As she’s grown, her goals have shifted. Therapy sessions now focus on things like jumping, running, and improving balance. Watching her learn to stand up from the floor without using anything for support was a huge milestone, and her confidence continues to grow with every new challenge. The one-on-one sessions in quiet rooms help her focus on mastering new skills.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.easterseals.com/get-support/areas-of-support/physical-therapy-easterseals" target="_blank">Easterseals</a></h3>
      <p>
        Gwen also received physical therapy through Easterseals as part of her early intervention classroom. It wasn’t her first therapy experience, but it was a valuable complement to outpatient sessions. The therapy was built into her school day and focused on helping her apply skills in a classroom environment—navigating different surfaces, climbing steps, and playing alongside peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The classroom setting made things more dynamic. Practicing balance or coordination while surrounded by other kids gave her a different kind of challenge than quiet, focused sessions. It helped her grow more adaptable and gave her chances to build confidence through real-life movement and play.
      </p>

      <h3>Preschool-Based Therapy</h3>
      <p>
        Gwen now receives physical therapy through her preschool as part of her IEP. It’s a new environment, but that same idea carries through. Practicing skills like stepping over a hurdle or balancing on one foot in a quiet room is one thing—but doing it in a busy classroom with other kids running around takes a different level of focus and confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having access to therapy in multiple settings has helped Gwen grow stronger and more confident. Each environment brings its own set of challenges, and that variety has helped her apply what she learns across different parts of her life. She’s learning to move, play, and keep up in all kinds of spaces.
      </p>
