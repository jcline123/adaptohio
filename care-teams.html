      <p>
        We chose to go with Nationwide Children’s Hospital because it was part of our care journey from day one. Gwen was born at Riverside Hospital in Columbus, which is affiliated with Children’s, and before we were even discharged we already had our first orthopedic appointment scheduled. That made everything feel a little easier. Children’s also has a dedicated limb difference clinic, and from our earliest conversations with her orthopedic doctors and surgeons, we felt like Gwen was in very good hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        I often think about how lucky we were not to have to travel for care. Limb difference is a rare diagnosis, and finding the right team can be overwhelming. In Gwen’s case, she was born without feet and her needs were actually fairly straightforward compared to many other cases. We didn’t have to weigh options like limb lengthening versus amputation. She did need an amputation on one side and a plastic surgery procedure on the other, but the path forward was clear. I know not every family has that kind of clarity, and I hope this page helps provide some reassurance and starting points.
      </p>

      <p>
        After her surgeries, we were surprised to learn that Children’s didn’t make the prosthetics. Like many new parents, we assumed that everything would happen through the hospital. Suddenly we were trying to figure out how to find a prosthetist. We called a few different companies in the area and ended up choosing Hanger Clinic. Their office was close to home, and the prosthetist we spoke to on the phone took the time to explain the process and even gave us a list of questions to ask other providers. He still works with us today.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ve had a good experience with both Children’s and Hanger. Our prosthetist actually attends many of our orthopedic appointments, which is incredibly helpful. Having your doctor and prosthetist in the same room talking through adjustments and decisions has made a big difference. This is the only provider team we’ve used so far, but we’ve been really happy with the care and support Gwen has received.
